    "In this assignment, you will explore Git in more depth, focusing on commands we have not covered in class. You should research how to solve each task using specific Git commands. Feel free to use any tools you prefer to complete the assignment. Explain each command in simple terms. Of course, you are welcome to test them as well! If you have any questions, please let me know.\n",
